      My name is Andrew Wei. I'm currently in my last year of medical school at Northwestern. <br> <br>
      I'm taking this software development class to learn some additional skills before starting residency.
      I hope that what I learn in this class might help me one day to develop tools to help physicians take better care of their patients.
